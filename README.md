# Deep-learning
Training a neural network with 1 hidden layer to predict the output for given input.

1) For calculation and concepts regarding the algorithm please see the attached pdf, I have done rough calculation for forward and backward pass, error funtion, sigmoid derivative.

2) I have used pycharm with numpy library.
